# Django Template Project

Expected Python Version: 3.13.x

## Purpose

This project is intended as:

- a kick-off point for projects
- an evolving codebase which implements our best practices at the time
- a place where I can document decisions that have been made about practices
  - e.g.: why X was picked, why Y was avoided (+ pros & cons)

## Usage

To create a new project from this template, you must will need to use
[cookiecutter][cookiecutter]. The simplest way to do this is to install it with
[pipx][pipx]:

```shell
pipx install cookiecutter
```

This will ensure that the `cookiecutter` command is available in your shell. From there
you can create a new project with the following command:

```shell
> cookiecutter /path/to/template
[1/4] project_name (Cookiecutter Website Simple):
...
```

Cookiecutter will then guide you through the rest of the process.
